1. Installation and Setup

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

You can install all dependencies by running the above command in your terminal.

2. Dataset Overview

Dataset Used: Describe the dataset used for building the recommendation system, including its source and structure.

Features: Highlight the key features in the dataset.

3. Data Preparation

Steps:

Data Loading: Load the dataset into the notebook using Pandas.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the data distributions and relationships.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and any data inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: Create new features if necessary to enhance the model's performance.

4. Model Building

Steps:

Choosing the Model: Select the appropriate recommendation algorithm (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering).

Model Training: Train the model using the prepared data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model parameters for better performance.

5. Evaluation

Steps:

Performance Metrics: Define and calculate metrics such as RMSE, MAE, precision, recall, etc.

Model Validation: Validate the model using a test dataset or cross-validation.

6. Generating Recommendations

Steps:

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict ratings or preferences.

Top-N Recommendations: Generate the top N recommendations for a user or item.

7. Conclusion

Summarize the findings, performance of the recommendation system, and any potential improvements for future iterations.
